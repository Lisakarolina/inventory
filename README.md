# Plant Inventory

This is an inventory app that shows categories of plants and the respective individual plants in each category. It is also possible to add new categories and plants.
The used technologies are Express, MongoDB and Bootstrap.
I took inspiration from [MDN's Local Library Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website), mainly for the templates of the view engine.
